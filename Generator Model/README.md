# Ollama 3.2 ChatBot

Welcome to the Ollama 3.2 ChatBot repository! This project features an interactive chatbot built using **Streamlit** for the web interface and **OllamaLLM** (Langchain integration with Ollama 3.2) for generating intelligent responses.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Users can interact with the chatbot and ask questions.
- **History Management**: The chatbot retains conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
- **Streamlit UI**: A simple and modern web interface to interact with the chatbot.
- **Response Generation**: Utilizes the Ollama 3.2 LLM to generate detailed, human-like responses based on user queries.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main Python files:

1. **`response_generation.py`**: This file handles the response generation logic using Ollama 3.2 LLM.
2. **`chatbot.py`**: The main file which creates the Streamlit interface for user interaction.
